## Why AgentWatch

### AI work is now a *team effort*, not a single prompt

Modern AI-assisted tasks — such as "analyse this ticket and produce a deliverable" — are no longer handled by one big prompt. They are broken into a **pipeline of specialised agents**, because that produces more accurate and maintainable results:

```
Developer submits a task
        │
  ┌─────▼─────┐
  │Orchestrator│ (the "manager" agent)
  └─────┬─────┘
   ┌─────────┼─────────┬──────────┐
   ▼         ▼         ▼          ▼
Requirements Context Processing Drafting
 Analysis   Gathering   Agent     Agent
  Agent      Agent               │
                                  ▼
                            Review Agent
                                  │
                                  ▼
                            Final Output
```

Each agent handles one concern and hands its work to the next. The result is better quality — but also a chain of **many hidden contributors** behind every output.

### The terminal hides the story

All of this runs as a wall of scrolling terminal text: hundreds of messages, many agents, intermediate files, tool calls, and long reasoning chains.

The information **exists** in those logs — but it is nearly impossible to consume. Even simple questions become hard to answer:

- *Which agent made this decision?*
- *Which piece of information led to this output?*
- *Where did this mistake actually start?*
- *Which agent should we improve?*

### The feedback problem

Imagine the final output is wrong. The natural reaction is to "give Claude feedback." But the reviewer only sees the **final result** — not which agent introduced the error.

So the feedback comes out generic:

> *"The output is wrong. Please improve the skill."*

The AI then **guesses** where to apply the fix — and often guesses wrong. The real cause might have been the Context Gathering Agent, but the fix lands somewhere else. Repeated over weeks, this creates **workflow drift**: the workflow keeps changing based on inaccurate feedback, slowly getting worse instead of better.

> **You cannot improve what you cannot see — and you cannot give good feedback on what you do not understand.**

## Who AgentWatch helps

| Audience | What they get |
| --- | --- |
| **Developers / engineers** | Stop scrolling terminals; pinpoint and fix the real cause fast |
| **Reviewers / QA** | Trace outputs to their source; give feedback that actually lands |
| **Team leads** | See how workflows evolve; trust that improvements are evidence-based |
| **The organisation** | Reliable, continuously-improving AI workflows instead of silent drift |

---

## The insight

The fix is not better prompting. It is **better visibility**.

Once you can observe a workflow properly, a natural progression appears:

| Step | What it unlocks |
| --- | --- |
| **Observability** — see what happened | You understand the run |
| **Targeted feedback** — point at the real cause | The right thing gets fixed |
| **Continuous improvement** — evidence-based fixes | The workflow gets better |
| **Self-healing** — the workflow analyses itself | Improvement happens automatically |

AgentWatch is built to support all four steps (self-healing in progress).

---

## How AgentWatch works

### It reads what Claude already records

While working with Claude Code, we found that **everything is already stored locally** on the machine, under a hidden `.claude` folder — every project, session, agent, message, artifact, and piece of metadata.

Nothing extra needs to be instrumented or logged. The raw truth is already there; it is just unreadable in its raw form.

```
.claude (raw local data)  →  AgentWatch (makes sense of it)  →  Your Browser
```

AgentWatch reads what Claude already records and builds a clear, human-friendly layer on top of it. Because it reads the **actual recorded session**, it always shows **what really happened at that point in time** — not a guess, and not today's version of the workflow. Historical runs stay faithful even after the underlying skills or agents are later edited.

### Integration with Claude Code

AgentWatch does not just read from Claude Code — it integrates with Claude Code's native features to provide a seamless browser-based experience:

| Integration point | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Session resume** | Improvement cycles resume the original Claude Code session (`--resume`), giving the improvement agent full context from the original run |
| **PreToolUse hooks** | An HTTP hook routes Edit/Write permission requests to the browser UI instead of the terminal |
| **Directory access** | Cross-project skill directories are granted read access via `--add-dir` |
| **Stream protocol** | Real-time progress is delivered via Claude Code's `stream-json` output format, displayed live in the browser |

This means the entire improvement workflow — from feedback to analysis to file edits to approval — happens in the browser. The terminal is only needed to *run* the original workflow.

### Browser-based permission handling

In a standard terminal session, Claude Code is interactive. When the AI decides it needs to edit a file, it pauses and shows a permission prompt. AgentWatch runs Claude Code **programmatically and headlessly** (no terminal), so this terminal prompt is not available.

Rather than bypassing Claude Code's permission system, AgentWatch plugs into it using Claude Code's official **PreToolUse hook API**. The hook intercepts a tool call before it executes and delegates the approval decision to the browser.

```
Claude Code attempts Edit/Write
        │
  PreToolUse hook fires
        │
  HTTP POST → AgentWatch server
        │
  WebSocket broadcast → Browser
        │
  User sees diff preview → Clicks Approve or Deny
        │
  Decision flows back: Browser → WebSocket → Hook → Claude Code
        │
  Claude Code applies the edit itself (on approval)
```

| Aspect | Terminal | AgentWatch (Browser) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Where the prompt appears** | Terminal (text) | Browser (visual card with diff) |
| **How the user responds** | Types `y` or `n` | Clicks Approve or Deny |
| **Who applies the edit** | Claude Code | Claude Code (same) |
| **Headless compatible** | No — auto-denies | Yes — hook routes to browser |

AgentWatch does not bypass, replace, or reimplement Claude Code's permission system. It uses the **official hook API** to relocate the human-in-the-loop from the terminal to the browser.

---

## How AgentWatch differs from general observability tools

Tools like LangSmith, LangFuse, and Weave are built for developers who are building agentic applications. They work by integrating an SDK into application code — you wrap your LLM calls, add decorators, or route traffic through their platform as part of the development process. The target user is an engineer writing the agent code; the goal is to debug and evaluate it while building.

AgentWatch solves a different problem entirely. It is not a developer instrumentation tool. It is an observation and improvement platform for people who are running Claude Code workflows — developers, reviewers, and team leads who use Claude Code's skills and agents to do work, and want to understand what happened, give precise feedback, and make the workflows better over time.

| | LangSmith / LangFuse / Weave | AgentWatch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary audience** | Developers building agent applications | Anyone running Claude Code workflows |
| **When you use it** | During development, while writing agent code | After a workflow run, to observe and improve it |
| **How it works** | SDK integration — you instrument your code | Zero instrumentation — reads what Claude Code already writes to disk |
| **What it observes** | LLM calls you explicitly wrap | Every agent, message, tool call, artifact, and reasoning chain — retroactively |
| **Improvement loop** | Evaluation and debugging | Feedback → targeted fix → per-edit approval → rerun → compare |
| **Awareness of Claude Code concepts** | None | Native — understands skills, agents, sessions, improvement cycles, hooks |

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Framework** | Next.js (App Router) + React, TypeScript |
| **Data store** | SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) — a local file, no external database or server to stand up |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket (`ws`) — pushes live analysis and approval events to the browser |
| **Runtime** | Node.js 22+ |

AgentWatch is **self-hosted** — no cloud, no account, no upload. It runs on your machine and reads your local `~/.claude` folder directly.

---

## Getting started

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makum07/agent-watch-application.git
cd agent-watch-application
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+ and npm.

**Step 1 — Install and start**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:server
```

By default AgentWatch auto-detects your Claude data at `~/.claude` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.claude` (Windows) — no configuration needed for a standard install.

**Step 2 — (Optional) Point to a non-standard Claude data path**

If your `.claude` folder lives somewhere else, copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and set `CLAUDE_HOME`:

```env
# macOS / Linux
CLAUDE_HOME=~/.claude

# Windows
CLAUDE_HOME=C:/Users/YourName/.claude
```

Everything else in `.env.local.example` is also optional and commented out — defaults work for most setups.

Open [http://localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456).

If you update Node.js or switch versions and see a 500 error on load, rebuild the native SQLite module:

```bash
npm run rebuild-native
```

**Reset the database** (clears the SQLite cache; sessions are re-indexed on next open):

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

### What happens on first open

The home page auto-discovers all Claude sessions from your `~/.claude/projects/` directory and lists them sorted by most recent. Click any session to open it. The first open of a session parses and indexes it — subsequent opens are served from the local SQLite cache instantly.

---

## A typical user journey

```
1. Run a Claude workflow as usual (e.g. "analyse this ticket and produce a deliverable").
   ↓
2. Open AgentWatch in the browser → pick the project → open the session.
   ↓
3. Read the agent hierarchy: see the orchestrator and every specialist agent.
   ↓
4. Check the analytics dashboard for an objective execution summary:
   cost, timing, cache efficiency, and any detected issues.
   ↓
5. Use AI Execution Analysis to understand how each agent followed its
   skill/agent instructions — and identify which agent needs feedback.
   ↓
6. Leave precise feedback on THAT agent / artifact — not on "the skill."
   Track all open feedback on the session-wide review page.
   ↓
7. Apply Improvements: AgentWatch turns the feedback into a targeted,
   evidence-based fix prompt. Review and approve each individual edit
   in the browser before it lands.
   ↓
8. Re-run the workflow to verify the improvement.
   ↓
9. Over many runs, watch trends in the Skills Dashboard.
   Enable self-healing (in progress) to let the workflow analyse and improve itself.
```

## Feature walkthrough

The features below are described in the order a user typically encounters them.

### Session Dashboard — runs become first-class

Browse projects and the sessions inside them, instead of digging through terminal history. Each run is a real, openable thing with a title, size, cost, and timing. Sessions can be pinned, tagged, and annotated. Sessions are organised by project, so related runs are always grouped together.

![Home page with sessions listed, grouped by project](<UI screenshots/Home page with session listed grouped by projects.png>)

**Why it matters:** runs stop being throwaway terminal output and become a reviewable, searchable record.

### Agent Hierarchy — see the team

A sidebar shows the full **tree of agents**: the orchestrator at the top and every specialist beneath it, in the order they ran, each labelled with its real name/role, model, tokens, duration, and health.

The hierarchy can also be viewed as a **Sequence** (chronological) view, and exported as clean text, SVG, PNG, or structured JSON for documentation, emails, and reviews.

**Why it matters:** in seconds you understand *who did what and in what order* — the thing that is impossible in a terminal.

### Multi-Pane Workspace — your investigation surface

The workspace is a flexible, multi-pane environment. Open any agent, artifact, timeline, analytics view, or context graph in its own pane. Split horizontally or vertically and compare anything side by side. Artifacts open **inside the pane** — no separate window or navigation needed — so you can view intermediate outputs while keeping the agent conversation in view. Your layout is automatically saved and restored as a **workspace snapshot**.

![Session workspace with multi-pane support and in-pane artifact viewer](<UI screenshots/Session workspace with Multi pane support and in pane artifact viewer.png>)

**Why it matters:** instead of scrolling endlessly, you build a focused investigation layout tailored to what you need to understand.

### Agent Detail — the full record of one agent

Open any agent to see its **Conversation**, the **Artifacts** it produced, the **Context** it received, the **Tools** it used, a **Summary**, and a **Feedback** tab. Health is shown honestly — a clean success looks different from "finished, but with errors or blocked actions."

**Why it matters:** you can trace a single agent's reasoning and outputs without losing the thread.

### Artifact Viewing — intermediate work becomes visible

The files agents create and pass between each other become **first-class, traceable items** rather than hidden intermediate outputs. Browse them in a folder structure, preview their content inside the active pane, and trace which agent produced each one.

**Why it matters:** you can follow the chain — which artifact influenced which result.

### Cross-Agent Search — find anything, anywhere

Full-text search across every agent's messages in a session. Filter by agent, role, or content type to locate specific decisions, tool calls, or outputs.

**Why it matters:** when you know *what* you are looking for but not *where*, search gets you there in seconds.

### Context Flow — trace information between agents

A visual graph showing how context flows between agents — which agent received information from which other agent, and what was passed along.

**Why it matters:** when a downstream agent makes a bad decision, you can trace it back to the context it received.

### Execution Timeline — see when things happened

A dedicated timeline view showing agents as they executed over time, with artifact markers. See parallelism, gaps, and ordering at a glance.

**Why it matters:** understand the *when* and *how long* alongside the *what* — spot bottlenecks and idle time.

### Analytics Dashboard — evidence-based execution metrics

The analytics page provides **computed facts** about every session:

| Metric area | What you see |
| --- | --- |
| **Summary metrics** | Total agents, tokens, cost, duration, models used, cache efficiency |
| **Cost breakdown** | By model, by agent, and by phase |
| **Critical path** | The longest chain of dependent agents that determined total duration |
| **Debug alerts** | Automatically detected issues: bottlenecks, retry loops, duplicate work, excessive tool usage, context bloat |
| **Agent report cards** | Per-agent outcome assessment with token efficiency and error categorisation |

**Why it matters:** you get an objective, quantitative view of what happened — not opinions, but evidence.

### AI Execution Analysis — identify which agents need feedback

This is the bridge between observing a run and knowing exactly where feedback should go.

AgentWatch builds a rich prompt containing the full session structure, agent hierarchy, tool call timelines, artifacts, and — crucially — the **skill and agent instructions** each agent was operating under. Claude then analyses the session **against those instructions**, identifying where each agent fell short, deviated, or succeeded.

The result is not a general performance report. It is a targeted answer to the question: *"Which agent should I give feedback to, and why?"*

![Analysing the session execution against skill/agent instructions using AI analysis](<UI screenshots/Analysing the session execution against the instruction of skill or agent using AI analysis for insights on giving feedback.png>)

The AI analysis surfaces:
- Where an agent's output diverged from what its skill or agent instructions required
- Root causes for failures, traced back to the specific agent that introduced them
- Delegation quality — whether the orchestrator split work appropriately
- Concrete, agent-specific improvement recommendations

The analysis streams live in the browser — thinking blocks, tool calls (colour-coded by type), text output, and progress indicators auto-scroll as new events arrive. Each analysis cycle is stored for future reference.

**Why it matters:** instead of guessing which agent caused a problem, you get an evidence-based answer grounded in the actual instructions the agents were given — so your feedback lands on the right target.

### Feedback — the most important capability

Feedback is attached to the **exact agent, the exact execution, and the exact artifact** that caused an issue — not to "the workflow" in general. Once you know from the AI analysis which agent to target, you attach structured feedback directly to it.

```
AI Analysis identifies the agent → Feedback attached to that agent
→ Specific Execution → Specific Artifact
```

Ten structured categories keep feedback precise:

| Category | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| Missing context | The agent lacked information it needed |
| Incorrect assumption | The agent assumed something false |
| Hallucinated conclusion | The agent stated something that was not in its context |
| Weak validation | The agent accepted a result it should have questioned |
| Missing edge case | The agent did not handle a known scenario |
| Missing artifact | The agent should have produced an output it did not |
| Missing code exploration | The agent did not read relevant code |
| Missing test coverage | A test scenario was omitted |
| Workflow improvement | The overall flow could be structured better |
| Other | Free-form notes |

A **session-wide review page** aggregates all feedback items from the session in one place, so you can see the full picture — which agents have open feedback, which issues have been addressed, and what still needs attention — without jumping between agent views.

![Targeted feedback attachment and session-wide feedback tracking on the review page](<UI screenshots/Targeted feedback attachment and session wide feedback tracking on review page.png>)

**Why it matters:** feedback becomes specific and evidence-based. The session-wide review page ensures nothing gets lost and every open issue is visible at a glance.

### Apply Improvements — turn notes into a precise fix

AgentWatch summarises the collected feedback and generates an improvement prompt grounded in **agent-specific evidence**, not vague impressions. Claude then applies the fix in a live, streaming session.

The key feature here is **per-edit approval**: every individual Edit or Write operation Claude proposes is intercepted by the PreToolUse hook and routed to the browser. You see a diff preview, the target file, and Approve / Deny buttons — and you decide on each change separately. Claude Code applies the edit itself after approval, keeping its internal state in sync with the filesystem.

This is not a bulk approve-or-reject. You review and approve or deny **each edit individually** before it lands.

![Improving a skill based on feedback, with per-edit approval support](<UI screenshots/Improving skill based on feedback with Approve on edit support.png>)

**Why it matters:** the improvement targets the real cause, you stay in control of exactly what changes, and you never need to switch to the terminal to approve edits.

### Cross-Project Skill Improvements — fix skills wherever they live

Real-world workflows often span multiple projects. A session might run in one repository but use skills and agents defined in a separate shared config repository.

AgentWatch handles this automatically:

1. **Detection** — When an improvement cycle starts, AgentWatch parses the session data to find every `.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents` path referenced during the run. Any path outside the session's own project directory is identified as external.
2. **Read access** — External directories are passed to Claude Code via the `--add-dir` flag, granting native read access without extra approval prompts.
3. **Write access** — Edits to external files go through the same browser-based per-edit approval gate as local edits.

**Why it matters:** improvements land where the root cause actually lives, even when skills are maintained in a separate repository.

### Improvement History — every change is traceable

Each improvement cycle is recorded — the feedback behind it, the generated prompt, the streaming response, and the file diffs it produced. Any improvement cycle can be **rewound** if it did not work out.

**Why it matters:** you can see how a workflow evolved over time, why each change was made, and undo what did not help.

### Skills Dashboard — learn across many runs

Instead of improving one run at a time, the Skills Dashboard aggregates execution data, feedback, and improvement history across **all sessions** that used a given skill. It answers: *"How is this workflow performing over time, and what keeps going wrong?"*

#### Skills list

The top-level skills page shows every registered skill as a card, organised by project. Each card displays the skill name, project, description, execution count, session count, feedback count, average duration, and self-healing status.

Skills are discovered automatically from Claude Code session data — not configured manually. When a session uses a skill (slash command), AgentWatch records the invocation and builds the skill registry from actual usage.

![Skill dashboard to analyse a skill across sessions, with self-heal configuration](<UI screenshots/Skill dashboard to analyse the skill across the sessions and with option to configure the self heal(just ui created).png>)

#### Skill detail — four tabs

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Self-healing configuration, skill metadata, top feedback categories |
| **Executions** | Paginated table of every execution: session, agent, timing, feedback count |
| **Feedback** | Three views: by session, by category (bar chart + top agents breakdown), and full history (improvement cycles + analysis cycles + open/closed feedback items) |
| **Analysis** | Preview/edit the analysis prompt, trigger analysis, view live stream, review cycle history and parsed recommendations |

#### AI-powered skill analysis

The Analysis tab lets you ask Claude to analyse a skill's entire execution history — drawing on **both accumulated feedback and past improvement cycle data** across all sessions — and produce prioritised recommendations. This cross-session view reveals patterns that no single run can show: recurring failure modes, feedback categories that keep appearing, and whether past improvements actually stuck.

![Analysing a skill with AI using feedback and improvement cycle data across sessions](<UI screenshots/Analysing the skill with ai using feedback and improvement cycle data across the sessions.png>)

**Why it matters:** you stop fixing single executions and start improving the **workflow itself** — with evidence from every run, not just the last one.

### Self-Healing — workflows that improve themselves

**Status:** 🔧 In Progress — UI ready, automation being implemented

The Self-Healing feature provides the configuration UI for enabling automatic skill improvement. When complete, a skill will be able to **analyse its own history** after a configurable number of runs, produce an improvement report and a suggested fix, which you then review and apply.

```
Skill → N Executions → Automatic Analysis → Improvement Report
→ Generated Fix → Human Review → Apply
```

Three planned operating modes:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Analysis only** | Produces the report and recommendations — you decide what to do |
| **Analysis and fix** | Generates the fix — you review and approve before it lands |
| **Fully automatic** | Analyses, generates, and applies the fix — you review after the fact |

The self-healing configuration UI is available on the Skills Dashboard (Overview tab), where you can toggle self-healing on or off and select a mode. The underlying automation is being implemented.

**Why it matters:** when complete, AgentWatch will graduate from an observability tool to a **workflow-evolution platform** — one that can propose and apply its own improvements based on accumulated evidence.

### Threshold Alerts — know when sessions need attention

As Claude Code sessions run — sometimes for hours, sometimes in parallel — cost and duration can grow without anyone noticing. AgentWatch includes a **threshold monitoring system** that continuously watches active sessions and alerts you when they cross configurable limits.

#### How monitoring works

A background monitor runs every **2 minutes** inside the AgentWatch server process:

```
Active Sessions → Scan (every 2 min) → Compare cost and duration against thresholds
→ DB Alert + WebSocket → Teams Notification (consolidated)
→ Auto-resolve when session ends
```

Each cycle, the monitor scans all active session files, computes current cost and duration, compares against configured thresholds, creates alerts in the database, and broadcasts real-time updates to the browser via WebSocket.

#### Alerts page

![Alerts tab showing alerts for active sessions whose cost or time crossed the configured threshold](<UI screenshots/Alerts tab where the alerts are created for the active sessions whose cost or time has been crossed the configured threshold.png>)

The Alerts page in the browser shows:

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Active alerts** | Sessions currently exceeding a threshold, with session title (linked), threshold type, actual vs. threshold value, cost, tokens, duration, and a Dismiss button |
| **Resolved alerts** | Collapsible section showing alerts that auto-resolved when the session ended |
| **Settings** | Cost threshold (dollars), duration threshold (hours), and Teams webhook URL |

Setting a threshold to 0 disables that check. Dismissed alerts are suppressed for the remainder of that session to prevent alert fatigue.

#### Teams notifications

Every monitor cycle sends a **single consolidated notification** to Microsoft Teams via a Power Automate webhook. The card includes:

- A header with the check timestamp and threshold values
- Summary metrics — total cost across all breaching sessions and session count
- Per-session rows — each breaching session listed with its title (clickable link to the AgentWatch workspace), cost, token count, duration, and source
- An action button linking to the AgentWatch Alerts page

![Session alerts sent to a Teams channel via webhook](<UI screenshots/The session alerts sent to teams channel using webhook.png>)

Notifications are sent every cycle for every active session crossing the threshold — not just once per alert. This is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight: a session that has crossed a threshold is usually still **actively running**, which means cost and duration keep climbing after the first alert. If AgentWatch only sent one notification per breach, a user who misses that single message — away from Teams, notification buried, on a call — would have no further signal that the session is still burning cost well past the threshold. Repeating the notification every 2-minute cycle, with updated cost/duration numbers each time, means a missed first alert doesn't turn into a silent, unbounded overrun.

To keep this from becoming noisy once a session **has** been reviewed, the Alerts page **Dismiss** button suppresses further notifications for that specific session and threshold for the rest of its run — so the repetition only continues for sessions nobody has acknowledged yet.

**Why it matters:** cost and duration surprises are caught early, with real-time browser alerts and recurring Teams notifications.

### Multi-Source Support — WSL, Windows, and beyond

AgentWatch can read Claude data from **multiple sources** on the same machine — for example, a native Windows `.claude` folder and a WSL Linux `.claude` folder. Switch between sources from the home page.

**Why it matters:** if you use Claude across environments, you see all your work in one place.

### Export — take insights with you

Export session data as JSON, Markdown, or HTML. Export the agent hierarchy as text, SVG, PNG, or JSON. Copy the analytics summary as structured text for pasting into improvement prompts or reports.

**Why it matters:** insights are portable — share them in emails, documents, pull requests, and team discussions.

## Current status

AgentWatch is an **actively-developed internal tool**, not a finished, versioned product.

| Aspect | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage today** | In daily use inside the team — 2 developers run it against their real Claude Code sessions as part of their normal workflow, not as a demo |
| **Deployment model** | Self-hosted, single-user per instance — each person runs their own local copy against their own `~/.claude` data. No shared server or multi-tenant deployment yet |
| **Feature completeness** | Observability, feedback, and apply-improvements are stable and used daily. Self-Healing (automatic fix generation) has its UI built but the automation behind it is still being implemented — see the Self-Healing section above |
| **Release process** | None yet — no version numbers, changelog, or support SLA. Updates land straight on the main branch |
| **Best fit today** | Individual developers or reviewers who want visibility into their own Claude Code sessions. Not yet built for team-wide shared dashboards |

**Why it matters:** tells you whether to adopt it as-is for your own day-to-day use today, or wait for shared hosting and self-healing automation before planning team-wide rollout.

---

## The bigger picture

As more work is delegated to AI agents, workflows become increasingly autonomous. The more autonomous they are, the more **observability becomes mandatory** — because you cannot improve what you cannot observe.

AgentWatch provides the full progression for Claude-based workflows:

> We started with a simple question — *how do we observe multi-agent workflows?* That led to **feedback**. Feedback led to **continuous improvement**. And continuous improvement leads toward **self-healing AI systems**.
